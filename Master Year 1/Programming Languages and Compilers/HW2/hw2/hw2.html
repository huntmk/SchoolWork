Programming Assignment 2<br>
CS 51530<br>
Programming Languages, Interpreters and Compilers<br>
Spring, 2021
</h1>

<p>
This assignment makes use of the files contained in this <a href="hw2.zip">zip file</a>.
This assignment is due Monday, February 15.
</p>

<p>
This assignment is based on <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs51530/for-class/Language-3.zip">Language_3</a>. This is not a difficult assignment. It is meant to help you familiarize yourself with the interpreter code for Language_3.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is a file <code>Language_3a.txt</code> that describes a new language. Language_3a adds five new operators to Language_3. Your assignment is to add code to the interpreter for Language_3 so that the new interpreter can handle the new operators.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is the file <code>Evaluate_3a.java</code>. As distributed, this file is the interpreter for Language_3. Modify this file so that it handles the five new operators described in <code>Language_3a.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is a prettyprinter for trees, <code>PrettyPrinter.java</code>. But this prettyprinter is very verbose. Write a prettyprinter, called <code>PrettyPrinter2.java</code>, that does the following.
</p>
<ol>
<li>It always puts the left node inline with the root.
<li>It handles the special case when depth==1 by putting everything inline with the root.
<li>It handles the special case when depth==2 by putting everything inline with the root.
<li>All non-inlined child nodes are vertically aligned with the left node.
<li>All consecutive closing parentheses are at the end of a line.
</ol>
<p>
In the zip file there are output files <code>Language_3_Examples_output.txt</code> and <code>Language_3a_Examples_output.txt</code>. Look at that them to get a idea of what the prettyprinter should produce.
</p>

<p>
When you have finished implementing <code>Evaluate_3a.java</code> and <code>PrettyPrinter2.java</code>, then the file <code>Language_3a_Examples.java</code> should compile and run. The output from running this program should look exactly like the file <code>Language_3a_Examples_output.txt</code>. Also, make sure that you didn't break anything from Language_3. The program <code>Language_3_Examples.java</code> from the zip file should also compile and run correctly and the program's output should look exactly like the file <code>Language_3_Examples_output.txt</code> (every Language_3 expression is also a valid Language_3a expression).
</p>

<p>
You can interactively test your interpreter by using the two shell scripts <code>build_all_classes.cmd</code> and <code>build_jar_file.cmd</code> to build a REPL from your interpreter. Those two scripts build a jar file, <code>Language_3a.jar</code>, and then the script <code>Language_3a.cmd</code> will run the jar file.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs51530/handin.html">Turn in</a> a zip file called <code>CS51530Hw2Surname.zip</code> (where <code>Surname</code> is your last name) containing your versions of <code>Evaluate_3a.java</code> and <code>PrettyPrinter2.java</code> (just those two files). Be sure to put your name and email address in <b>every</b> file your turn in.
</p>

<p>
This assignment is due Monday, February 15.
