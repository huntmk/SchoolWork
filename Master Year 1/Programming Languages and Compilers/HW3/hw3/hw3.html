Programming Assignment 3<br>
CS 51530<br>
Programming Languages, Interpreters and Compilers<br>
Spring, 2021
</h1>

<p>
This assignment makes use of the files contained in this <a href="hw3.zip">zip file</a>.
This assignment is due Monday, March 8.
</p>

<p>
This assignment is based on <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs51530/for-class/Language-6.zip">Language_6</a> and <a href="http://math.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs51530/homework/hw2.html">programming assignment 2</a>. You will add two new expressions to Language_6 and also the five operators from Langauage_3a to create Language_6a.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is a file <code>Language_6a.txt</code> that describes the syntax and semantics of Language_6a. Language_6a adds for-loop and repeat-loop expressions to Language_6 and it also adds the five operators from Language_3a.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there is the file <code>Evaluate_6a.java</code>. As distributed, this file is the interpreter for Language_6. Your assignment is to copy your code for the five operators from Language_3a into <code>Evaluate_6a.java</code> and then add code that handles the two new loop expressions.
</p>

<p>
The for-loop in Language_6a should have the same semantics as a for-loop in Java or C++. In particular, be sure to notice the difference between (using Java/C++ notation)
</p>
<pre>
      int i = 0;
      for (i = 1; i < 3; ++i)
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
      for (int i = 1; i < 3; ++i)
</pre>
<p>
In the second for-loop, the variable <code>i</code> is declared local to the for-loop. In order to implement a local variable for a for-loop, your for-loop implementation will need to add an <code>Environment</code> object to the current environment chain, much like the <code>begin</code> expression. Your for-loop implementation should evaluate all four of the for-loop's expressions using the new environment chain (see the file <code>Language_6a.txt</code> for more details).
</p>

<p>
The repeat-loop expression is, unlike the while-loop and for-loop, a "real" expression in that it can compute a useful value (a while-loop, or a for-loop, always evaluates to <code>false</code> and is only useful for its side effects). A repeat-loop has two expressions. The second expression must evaluate to a boolean value. The first expression will provide the value of the repeat-loop expression. The repeat-loop first evaluates, and remembers the value of, its first expression. Then it evaluates its second expression. If the boolean value is false, then the repeat-loop is done and its value is the saved value from the first expression. If the boolean value is true, the repeat-loop should continue looping until the boolean value is false. The value of the repeat-loop expression will be the last evaluation of its first expression.
</p>

<p>
When you have finished implementing <code>Evaluate_6a.java</code>, include your version of <code>PrettyPrinter2.java</code> from Assignment 2 in the <code>hw3</code> folder. Then the file <code>Language_6a_Examples.java</code> should compile and run. The output from running this program should look exactly like <code>Language_6a_Examples_output_debug_0.txt</code> or <code>Language_6a_Examples_output_debug_1.txt</code>, depending on how you set the debug level. To help you with debugging, <code>Language_6a_Examples_output_debug_1.txt</code> includes all of the environment debugging output. It's a lot of text, but you might find it useful to trace how the environments are supposed to work in Language_6a. You get the interpreter to produce all this output by setting the static variable
</p>
<pre>
       DEBUG = 1;
</pre>
<p>
in the file <code>Evaluate_6a.java</code>.
</p>

<p>
Also, make sure that you didn't break anything from Language_6. The program <code>Language_6_Examples.java</code> from the zip file should compile and run correctly and the program's output should look exactly like <code>Language_6_Examples_output_debug_0.txt</code> or <code>Language_6_Examples_output_debug_1.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs51530/handin.html">Turn in</a> a zip file called <code>CS51530Hw3Surname.zip</code> (where <code>Surname</code> is your last name) containing your versions of <code>Evaluate_6a.java</code> and <code>PrettyPrinter2.java</code> (just those two files). Be sure to put your name and email address in <b>every</b> file your turn in.
</p>

<p>
This assignment is due Monday, March 8.
