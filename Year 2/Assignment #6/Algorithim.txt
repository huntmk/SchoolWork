THINGS TO DO:
Code Driver
Get Destructor going soon
**Driver.cpp**
variables/objects
	-decision variable to enter option
	-anotherDecision variable for second menu
	- create dynamic array to store data read in from file and use to sort.
	
Loop- while doesn't equal 2(to exit)
	-if decision equals 1, load data from file
	 	-use stringstream to parse string
		-use fstream to read file
		- (reference code in slides)
	- another while loop menu(doesn't equal 3)
		- if anotherDecision equals 1, use Insertion sort for data
			-then go back to main menu(print menu, ask for new decision variable)
		- if anotherDecision equals 2, use Bubble sort
			-then go back to main menu(print menu, ask for new decision variable)
		-else (if it's neither 1, 2, or 3) 
			-ask for new input

**Sort**
	*.h file*
	-create pure virtual method "sort" to be inherited by the two derived classes in order to sort the array

**Insertion Sort**
	*.h file* 
	-public virtual void sort();
	
	*.cpp file*
	need to include Sort in declaration
	- default constructor
	-
**Bubble Sort**
	*.h file* - need to find out what else to add
	- public virtual void sort();

	*.cpp file*
	- default constructor
	-
