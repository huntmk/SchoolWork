This where my algorithim will be!

main method
1. Both players will start 0
2. Start a while loop
3. Call the methods to advance the players
4. Check values of players so if there value is less than 0, set it to 0. And if greater than or equal to 50. Print  message saying who won.
5. Call print position method
6. If index for one of the players >= 50, stop loop

void advance methods
1.void advancePlayer methods, use random gen to come up with probablility for the cards drawn
2. If 'that card(random number)' is drawn, change index


print method
1.Make for statement, so for i = 0; and less than or equal to GAME_LEGNTH; increment i. Add and print newline before for statement so that new line is created everytime the function is called.
2. if playerA == i, print a and set width to i.
3. if playerB == i , print b and set width to i.
